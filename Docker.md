`docker run --name test -it debian` | 以debian镜像启动容器，命名为test | `-it` is short for `--interactive` + `--tty` when you docker run with this command.. it would take you straight inside of the container,, where `-d` is short for `--detach` which means you just run the container and then detach from it so basically you run container in the background..
