# 匹配指令
- `=` 绝对匹配
- `~` 正则匹配，区分大小写
- `~*` 正则匹配，不区分大小写
- 其余的都称为`前缀匹配`

# 匹配规则
1、nginx首先查找所有的前缀匹配，将路径最长的匹配规则记录下来
> 如果该路径最长的匹配规则，刚好有`^~`前缀，则使用该规则，并终止查找

2、然后，按从上到下的顺序，查找正则匹配；如果有命中，则使用该规则，并终止查找

3、如果没有命中，则使用第1步记录的前缀匹配规则


1、nginx first checks locations defined using the prefix strings (prefix locations). Among them, the location with the longest matching prefix is selected and remembered. 
  > If the longest matching prefix location has the “^~” modifier then regular expressions are not checked.

2、Then regular expressions are checked, in the order of their appearance in the configuration file. The search of regular expressions terminates on the first match, and the corresponding configuration is used.

3、If no match with a regular expression is found then the configuration of the prefix location remembered earlier is used.

From the [HTTP core module docs:](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location)


Example from the documentation:
```nginx
location  = / {
  # matches the query / only.
  [ configuration A ] 
}
location  / {
  # matches any query, since all queries begin with /, but regular
  # expressions and any longer conventional blocks will be
  # matched first.
  [ configuration B ] 
}
location /documents/ {
  # matches any query beginning with /documents/ and continues searching,
  # so regular expressions will be checked. This will be matched only if
  # regular expressions don't find a match.
  [ configuration C ] 
}
location ^~ /images/ {
  # matches any query beginning with /images/ and halts searching,
  # so regular expressions will not be checked.
  [ configuration D ] 
}
location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ {
  # matches any request ending in gif, jpg, or jpeg. However, all
  # requests to the /images/ directory will be handled by
  # Configuration D.   
  [ configuration E ] 
}
```
