From the [HTTP core module docs:](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location)

1、Directives with the "=" prefix that match the query exactly. If found, searching stops.

2、All remaining directives with conventional strings. If this match used the "^~" prefix, searching stops.

3、Regular expressions, in the order they are defined in the configuration file.

4、If #3 yielded a match, that result is used. Otherwise, the match from #2 is used.

Example from the documentation:
```nginx
location  = / {
  # matches the query / only.
  [ configuration A ] 
}
location  / {
  # matches any query, since all queries begin with /, but regular
  # expressions and any longer conventional blocks will be
  # matched first.
  [ configuration B ] 
}
location /documents/ {
  # matches any query beginning with /documents/ and continues searching,
  # so regular expressions will be checked. This will be matched only if
  # regular expressions don't find a match.
  [ configuration C ] 
}
location ^~ /images/ {
  # matches any query beginning with /images/ and halts searching,
  # so regular expressions will not be checked.
  [ configuration D ] 
}
location ~* \.(gif|jpg|jpeg)$ {
  # matches any request ending in gif, jpg, or jpeg. However, all
  # requests to the /images/ directory will be handled by
  # Configuration D.   
  [ configuration E ] 
}
```
