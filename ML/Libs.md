# Comparison
libs | tag | desc
-- | -- | --
Tersor Flow | low-level, industry, tflite for mobile, DL | made by google
PyTorch | middle-level, academic, DL | made by Facebook, widely used in research projects. allows almost unlimited customization
Keras | high-level, wrapper of TF | high level of TF
Scikit-learn | high-level, ML, Data Process | user-friendly framework that contains a great variety of useful tools: classification, regression and clustering models, as well a preprocessing, dimensionality reduction and evaluation tools.
numpy | data computing, matrices, fast | focus on data process, more api, faster than native python. dependency of many other library, such as sklearn
pandas | dataset manipulation | such as import from excel, High-performance merging and joining of data sets

> A default thing to do is to load/clean/manipulate your data using Pandas. Translate your Pandas DataFrame into a Numpy array and fed it to Scikit Learn function(s). Often this happens automatically so you won’t need to worry about this process.
