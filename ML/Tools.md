# Comparison
kit | tag | desc
-- | -- | --
Tersor Flow | low-level, industry, tflite for mobile, DL | made by google
PyTorch | middle-level, academic, DL | made by Facebook, widely used in research projects. allows almost unlimited customization
Keras | high-level, wrapper of TF | high level of TF
Scikit-learn | high-level, ML, Data Process | user-friendly framework that contains a great variety of useful tools: classification, regression and clustering models, as well a preprocessing, dimensionality reduction and evaluation tools.
